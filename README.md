# Classroom

## Introduction	

Classroom is a project to help teacher and student to run their academy life smoothly. It reduces the hassle of maintaining multiple platforms at a time to run a single course.

Here a teacher gets the opportunity to add multiple courses for his running semester. For each course, he can up the course content and grade for the student separately. He also keeps the restriction who are allowed to access the course content or not. Lecture of each course will be shown in a sperate page so the student can find all the content of a single lecture without mixing them up.

The important feature here, if a student needs to discuss something about a lecture, he or she can ask them on the lecture page. Group discussion definitely help to understand a lesson. And finally, the teacher can send any kind of notice by clicking a single button to the all enrolled student of a course. Notice will be sent to their email address too.
